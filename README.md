# Spherical-Point-In-Polygon

## 1. Project Overview

`Spherical-Point-In-Polygon` is a C++ library for:

- spherical point-in-polygon (PIP)
- robust geometric predicates on the sphere

The main target problem is classifying a query point on the unit sphere as:

- `Outside`
- `Inside`
- `OnVertex`
- `OnEdge`

Key properties:

- robust to common degeneracies
- three robustness tiers when global IDs are available
- two precision pipelines:
  - a pure robust pipeline
  - an EFT pipeline based on compensated arithmetic
- designed for correctness first, with performance-aware implementation choices

This repository contains the implementation. The associated paper discusses the
algorithms in more detail and provides broader algorithmic context:

### Installation

This library is designed to be used directly via headers.

Add the include path:

```text
-I/path/to/Spherical-Point-In-Polygon/include
```

Then include:

```cpp
#include <spip/algorithms/point_in_polygon_sphere.hpp>
```

### Quick Start

Minimal robust example without global IDs:

```cpp
#include <array>

#include <spip/algorithms/point_in_polygon_sphere.hpp>

const std::array<double, 3> q = {0.5773502691896257, 0.5773502691896257,
                                 0.5773502691896257};
const std::array<std::array<double, 3>, 3> poly = {{
    {1.0, 0.0, 0.0},
    {0.0, 1.0, 0.0},
    {0.0, 0.0, 1.0},
}};

const auto loc = spip::pip::point_in_polygon_sphere(q, poly);
```

Minimal Tier 1 global-ID example:

```cpp
#include <cstdint>

#include <spip/algorithms/point_in_polygon_sphere.hpp>

double q[3] = {0.5773502691896257, 0.5773502691896257, 0.5773502691896257};
double R[3] = {-0.5773502691896257, -0.5773502691896257, -0.5773502691896257};
double poly_storage[3][3] = {{1.0, 0.0, 0.0}, {0.0, 1.0, 0.0}, {0.0, 0.0, 1.0}};
const double* poly[3] = {poly_storage[0], poly_storage[1], poly_storage[2]};
const std::int64_t vertex_ids[3] = {10, 20, 30};

const auto loc =
    spip::pip::point_in_polygon_sphere(q, 40, R, 50, poly, vertex_ids, 3);
```

## 2. Core Algorithm (Spherical PIP)

The point-in-polygon test is parity-based. Given:

- `q`: the query point on the sphere
- `R`: a ray endpoint on the sphere
- `AB`: a polygon edge, interpreted as the minor great-circle arc from vertex `A` to vertex `B`

the algorithm counts how many polygon edges intersect the minor arc `qR`. An odd number of crossings means `Inside`; an even number means `Outside`.

The ray endpoint `R` is normally chosen as a perturbed antipode of `q`, so the ray is geometrically well separated from the query.

For each polygon edge `AB`, the crossing logic uses four orientation signs:

- `s_qR_A = orient(q, R, A)`
- `s_qR_B = orient(q, R, B)`
- `s_AB_q = orient(A, B, q)`
- `s_AB_R = orient(A, B, R)`

In the nondegenerate case, the implementation uses the strict 4-sign crossing theorem: the arcs `qR` and `AB` cross if and only if the endpoint orientations are strictly separated on both supporting great circles. In code, this is the branch where all four signs are nonzero and the sign pattern is checked directly.

When `s_qR_A` or `s_qR_B` is zero in the non-global-ID mode, the algorithm falls back to a half-open convention rather than symbolic perturbation. This is a deterministic local tie-breaking rule for degenerate ray/vertex configurations and avoids double counting.

Boundary handling is performed before parity counting:

- if `q` exactly matches a polygon vertex, return `OnVertex`
- if `q` lies on a polygon edge minor arc, return `OnEdge`


## 3. Ray Endpoint (R) Policy

The ray endpoint `R` is constructed as a perturbed antipode of `q`:

- start from `-q`
- perturb the least dominant coordinate
- renormalize to the sphere

The perturbation is needed to avoid the most obvious antipodal degeneracies.

Design decision:

If any polygon edge yields

`s_AB_R == 0`

then the algorithm throws an error.

Interpretation:

- this typically indicates a polygon that is too large, close to hemispherical, or otherwise poorly separated from the ray construction
- retrying with another `R` is intentionally not used, because that would make the classification rule path-dependent and harder to reason about

What users should do instead:

- split the polygon into smaller pieces, or
- use Tier 1 global-ID mode so endpoint degeneracies can be resolved symbolically where applicable


## 4. Precision Pipelines

The repository provides two precision pipelines.

### (1) Pure robust pipeline

- Shewchuk adaptive orientation predicates
- filtered quadruple product
- exact fallback via Geogram multiprecision

### (2) EFT pipeline

- compensated arithmetic based on error-free transforms
- same high-level algorithmic structure
- tolerance-based zero detection

**Important design rule:**

- The algorithm is intended to be identical across pipelines.
- Only the numerical evaluation of predicate signs differs.

The EFT implementation is largely informed by:

- Chen, H., Ullrich, P. A., and Panetta, J. (2025):  
  *Fast and Accurate Intersections on a Sphere*,  
  arXiv:2510.09892, https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09892.

- Ogita, T., Rump, S. M., and Oishi, S. (2005):  
  *Accurate sum and dot product*,  
  SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing, 26(6), 1955–1988,  
  https://doi.org/10.1137/030601818.

Both are related to:

- W. Kahan, "Lecture Notes on the Status of IEEE-754", 1996,
  http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~wkahan/ieee754status/IEEE754.PDF

in particular for the 2x2 determinant and FMA idea.


## 5. Non-global-ID Strategy

When global IDs are not provided:

- no Simulation of Simplicity (SoS) is used
- degeneracy is handled by a deterministic geometric rule
- this is local deterministic tie-breaking, not full global symbolic robustness

The non-global-ID crossing policy is:

- `s_AB_q == 0` -> treated as not crossing
  - boundary cases have already been handled by the explicit `OnVertex` / `OnEdge` checks
- `s_AB_R == 0` -> error
  - the ray construction is considered invalid for this polygon/query configuration
- if `s_qR_A` and `s_qR_B` are both nonzero
  - use the strict 4-sign theorem
- otherwise
  - use the half-open rule

Half-open rule:

```text
below_a = (s_qR_A < 0)
below_b = (s_qR_B < 0)

crossing only if:
(below_a XOR below_b)
```

This is a standard half-open convention in the style of Hormann and Agathos
(2001).

Important limitation:

- Hormann and Agathos discuss the half-open rule in the planar setting
- this repository works on the spherical surface
- this repository does not currently claim a global theoretical proof for the
  spherical no-global-ID tie-breaking rule
- in this repository, the half-open rule is used as a deterministic tie-breaking
  convention when no global ID is present and a degenerate ray/vertex case
  occurs
- behavior is deterministic and consistent
- but it is not equivalent to full global symbolic robustness
- if full global robustness is required, use Tier 1 global-ID mode


## 6. Robustness Tiers With Global IDs

When global IDs are available, the library supports three robustness tiers.

### Tier 1: full global robustness

User provides:

- polygon vertex coordinates and vertex IDs
- query point `q` and `q_id`
- outside point `R` and `r_id`

Properties:

- all participating points belong to one explicit symbolic ordering
- this is the strongest and most predictable mode
- degeneracies are resolved relative to caller-controlled global IDs

### Tier 2: semi-specified robustness

User provides:

- polygon vertex coordinates and vertex IDs
- query point `q` and `q_id`

Library does:

- infer `R`
- assign an internal ID to `R`

Properties:

- still globally consistent with respect to the polygon and `q`
- only `R` is synthetic

### Tier 3: local/internal robustness

User provides:

- polygon vertex coordinates and vertex IDs

Library does:

- assign an internal ID to `q`
- infer `R`
- assign an internal ID to `R`

Properties:

- deterministic
- consistent for a given call
- ordering involving `q` and `R` is library-defined
- this is local robustness only, not full global SoS


## 7. SoS (Simulation of Simplicity)

SoS is used only in global-ID paths.

It is applied only to the endpoint degeneracies:

- `s_qR_A == 0`
- `s_qR_B == 0`

It is not applied to:

- `s_AB_q`
- `s_AB_R`

Those remain exact geometric tests:

- `s_AB_q == 0` -> not crossing
- `s_AB_R == 0` -> error

Purpose of SoS:

- resolve ray-vertex degeneracy using symbolic ordering
- preserve deterministic crossing decisions when the ray passes through a vertex-level degenerate configuration


## 8. Internal ID Assignment

When the library assigns IDs internally:

1. compute the maximum polygon vertex ID
2. if `max_id + 2` is safe:
   - assign `q_id = max_id + 1` when needed
   - assign `r_id = max_id + 2`
3. otherwise:
   - compute a MEX over nonnegative integers
   - use the first unused ID for `q_id` when needed
   - use the second unused ID for `r_id`

Constraints:

- no negative IDs are used
- polygon vertex IDs are never modified
- internal IDs are always nonnegative


## 9. Tests and Visualization

Tests live in [tests/](tests/) and in the repository test directory on GitHub:

- https://github.com/hongyuchen1030/Spherical-Point-In-Polygon/tree/main/tests

Notable coverage includes:

- robust pipeline unit tests
- EFT pipeline unit tests
- robustness tiers with global IDs
- a more complicated polygon/query configuration

The Mathematica notebook
[tests/test_pip_complicated_visualization.nb](tests/test_pip_complicated_visualization.nb)
visualizes:

- the polygon
- the query points
- the query-to-ray great-circle arcs

That notebook is the visualization companion for the complicated PIP test case.
