# Spherical-Point-In-Polygon

`Spherical-Point-In-Polygon` is a C++ library for robust **spherical point-in-polygon (PIP)** classification and geometric predicates on the unit sphere.

The library classifies a query point as:

  * **`Outside`**
  * **`Inside`**
  * **`OnVertex`**
  * **`OnEdge`**

### Key Properties

  * **Robustness:** Handles common geometric degeneracies and numerical instabilities.
  * **Tiered Reliability:** Supports three robustness tiers when global IDs are available.
  * **Precision Pipelines:**
      * **Pure Robust:** Adaptive predicates (Shewchuk) + exact fallback (Geogram).
      * **EFT:** Compensated arithmetic based on Error-Free Transformations.
  * **Header-Only:** Designed for "correctness first" with easy integration.

This repository contains the implementation. The associated paper discusses the
algorithms in more detail and provides broader algorithmic context:

This library provides a complete API coverage across precision models, robustness modes, and container interfaces. In total, there are **24 API combinations**, formed by:

* **2 precision models**:

  * robust (adaptive exact predicates)
  * EFT (compensated arithmetic)

* **4 robustness modes**:

  * no global ID
  * Tier 1 (full global robustness)
  * Tier 2 (semi-specified global robustness)
  * Tier 3 (local/internal robustness)

* **3 API overload families**:

  * raw pointer
  * std::array
  * std::vector

These combinations ensure that users can choose the appropriate trade-off between robustness, performance, and interface convenience.

## 2\. Core Algorithm (Spherical PIP)

The ray endpoint `R` is normally chosen as a perturbed antipode of `q`, so the ray is geometrically well separated from the query.

For each polygon edge `AB`, the crossing logic uses four orientation signs:

- `s_qR_A = orient(q, R, A)`
- `s_qR_B = orient(q, R, B)`
- `s_AB_q = orient(A, B, q)`
- `s_AB_R = orient(A, B, R)`

In the nondegenerate case, the implementation uses the strict 4-sign crossing theorem: the arcs `qR` and `AB` cross if and only if the endpoint orientations are strictly separated on both supporting great circles. In code, this is the branch where all four signs are nonzero and the sign pattern is checked directly.

When `s_qR_A` or `s_qR_B` is zero in the non-global-ID mode, the algorithm falls back to a half-open convention rather than symbolic perturbation. This is a deterministic local tie-breaking rule for degenerate ray/vertex configurations and avoids double counting.

Boundary handling is performed before parity counting:

- if `q` exactly matches a polygon vertex, return `OnVertex`
- if `q` lies on a polygon edge minor arc, return `OnEdge`

The ray endpoint `R` is constructed as a perturbed antipode of `q`:

- start from `-q`
- perturb the least dominant coordinate
- renormalize to the sphere

The perturbation is needed to avoid the most obvious antipodal degeneracies.

Design decision:

If any polygon edge yields

`s_AB_R == 0`

then the algorithm throws an error.

Interpretation:

- this typically indicates a polygon that is too large, close to hemispherical, or otherwise poorly separated from the ray construction
- retrying with another `R` is intentionally not used, because that would make the classification rule path-dependent and harder to reason about

What users should do instead:

- split the polygon into smaller pieces, or
- use Tier 1 global-ID mode so endpoint degeneracies can be resolved symbolically where applicable

## 3\. Robustness Tiers (With Global IDs)

When global IDs are available, **Simulation of Simplicity (SoS)** resolves ray-vertex degeneracies.

| Tier | Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tier 1** | Full Global | User provides $q$, $R$, and vertex IDs. Strongest mode. |
| **Tier 2** | Semi-Specified | User provides $q$ and vertex IDs; Library infers $R$ and its ID. |
| **Tier 3** | Local/Internal | User provides vertex IDs; Library infers IDs for $q$ and $R$. |

-----

## 4\. Precision Pipelines

| Pipeline | Technology | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pure Robust** | Shewchuk + Geogram | Uses adaptive predicates and exact multiprecision fallback. |
| **EFT** | Ogita-Rump-Oishi | Uses Error-Free Transformations and compensated arithmetic. |

-----

## 5\. Non-Global-ID Strategy

When IDs are absent, the library falls back to a **deterministic local tie-breaking rule** (Half-Open Convention) rather than symbolic perturbation.

  * **Crossing Rule:** If $s_{qR,A}$ or $s_{qR,B}$ is zero, a crossing is counted only if `(below_a XOR below_b)`.
  * **Important:** This provides deterministic behavior but is not a substitute for full global symbolic robustness. Use Tier 1 if global SoS is required.

-----

## 6\. Internal ID Assignment

If the library must assign IDs internally (Tiers 2/3):

1.  It calculates the maximum vertex ID.
2.  It assigns `q_id` and `r_id` as `max_id + 1` and `max_id + 2` respectively.
3.  If IDs would overflow, it uses a **MEX** (Minimum Excluded value) over nonnegative integers.

-----

## 7\. Tests and Visualization

Detailed tests are located in [`tests/`](tests/).

  * **Unit Tests:** Covers both pipelines and all robustness tiers.
  * **Visualization:** `tests/test_pip_complicated_visualization.nb` (Mathematica) visualizes the polygon, query points, and great-circle arcs for complex cases.
